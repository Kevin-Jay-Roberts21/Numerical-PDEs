% Introductory Matlab script for solving the advection equation: 
% u_t + c*u_x = 0
% using simple upwinding
% 

% Set the parameters for the solution
L = 20; % length of solution domain (from zero)
J = 200; % number of grid points (not counting zero)
x = linspace(0,L,J+1); % set up a vector of x locations
dx = L/J; % size of a grid cell, delta x
c = 1; % advection speed
dt = 0.08; % size of time step, delta t

T = 15; % duraction of simulation
N = round(T/dt); % number of times to iterate simuation to get to time T

% set an initial condition
u0 = x./(x.^4 + 1);
up = u0; % up will denote u in the Present during the simulation

plot(x, u0, 'r') % plot the IC

% add labels to the plot
xlabel('x'), ylabel('u(x,t)')

for n = 1:N % beginning the for time loop
    
    up(1) = 0; % enforce the zero BC at x = 0
    
    for j = 2:J+1 % begin spatial loop; note that j = 1 is x = 0
        un(j) = up(j) - c*dt/dx*(up(j)-up(j-1));
    end % ending the spatial loop
    
    % to see results as an animation uncomment the line below and comment
    % the if - end statement
    
    plot(x,u0,'r',x,un,'b'), pause(.1) % plots the next calculated time slice and the IC for reference. Makes this an animation
    
    % if mod(n*dt,2) < dt % check if current time is close to a multiple of 2
    %     hold on, plot(x,un,'b'), hold off % if so, add a plot of current solution to existing plot
